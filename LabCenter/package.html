Short discussion of package dependencies.
The details will probably not be up to date,
but the general outline should be sound.<p>

<b>Launcher</b><p>

The launcher application uses just the one package <u>launch</u>,
which must be self-contained.<p>

<b>Library</b><p>

Most of the remaining packages form a reusable library of code
that is shared by LabCenter and other applications.<p>

The package <u>core</u> contains fundamental utilities that are
widely used.  All other packages probably depend on the core.<p>

Other package dependencies should be moderately rare.
The packages can be organized into four layers or units.<p>

<blockquote>

meta<br>
object<br>
<br>
struct<br>
misc<br>
<br>
table<br>
thread<br>
<br>
gui<br>
net<br>

</blockquote>

Here are the actual dependencies between packages.<p>

<blockquote>

meta <tt>-></tt> (none)<br>
object <tt>-></tt> (none)<br>
<br>
struct <tt>-></tt> meta object<br>
misc <tt>-></tt> meta object struct (and launch)<br>
<br>
table <tt>-></tt> meta object<br>
thread <tt>-></tt> meta object table<br>
<br>
gui <tt>-></tt> meta object struct misc table thread<br>
net <tt>-></tt> meta object struct misc thread<br>

</blockquote>

If you compile the packages in that order, that would
be an efficient way to go about it.<p>

If you want, you can get an updated list by searching for
the regular expression "import com\.lifepics\.neuron\.[^c]"
and ignoring results from non-library packages.<p>

The library also includes the <u>launch</u> package
since there are a few calls into it from <u>misc</u>.<p>

<b>LabCenter</b><p>

The code for LabCenter lives in the three packages <u>axon</u> (for upload),
<u>dendron</u> (for download), and <u>app</u>.  The first two depend only
on the library packages, while the third depends on that and the first two.<p>

<b>Other Applications</b><p>

Here's what some other packages are for.<p>

<blockquote>

config - ConfigCenter (not in same SourceSafe tree)<br>
admin - LabCenter Admin<br>
<br>
install - LabCenter Install, general-purpose installer configurable at run time<br>
helper - used to build helper.jar, a jar that contains installer helper functions<br>
<br>
setup - GUI installer component for Ritz<br>
lookup - unit that knows how to find the K-number on a kiosk<br>

</blockquote>

Any packages not listed here are probably for other applications.<p>
